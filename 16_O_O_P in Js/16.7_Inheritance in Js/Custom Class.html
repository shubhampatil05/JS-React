      // The JavaScript inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes on the basis of already existing classes. It provides flexibility to the child class to reuse the methods and variables of a parent class.

      // The JavaScript extends keyword is used to create a child class on the basis of a parent class. It facilitates child class to acquire all the properties and behavior of its parent class.

      // Points to remember

      // It maintains an IS-A relationship.
      // The extends keyword is used in class expressions or class declarations.
      // Using extends keyword, we can acquire all the properties and behavior of the inbuilt object as well as custom classes.
      // We can also use a prototype-based approach to achieve inheritance.

      //Custom class example..

      class Bike {
        constructor() {
          this.company = "Honda";
        }
      }

      class Vehical extends Bike {
        constructor(name, price) {
          super();
          this.name = name;
          this.price = price;
        }
      }
      var v = new Vehical("Unicorn", 140000);
      document.write(v.company + " " + v.name + " " + v.price);
